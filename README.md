### 👋 Welcome to my github profile! 👋
I recently graduated 🎓 from UIT, Barkatullah University, Bhopal, India in Computer Science and Engineering. 💻 It has been a great journey with abrupt ending due to COVID-19. 🦇😷 I love working with Python and databases. I love talking about environmentalism and minimalism, that will surely reflect on my code. Whenever I'm not learning or coding, you'll find me playing chess online or rewatching The Office.
